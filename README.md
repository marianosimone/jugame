My end-of-career project on building DSLs for Game Theory analysis

## Notes
This is the original version, with a mix of Spanish and English, and not very nice in general.

I may end up doing some cleanup and fixes over time, but just wanted to have it out there first.

## Content

- `doc`: Documents to understand this library as well as the topics related to it (i.e. DSLs and Game Theory)
- `examples`: Some scripts to run tournaments
- `lib`: The library itself
- `ruby`: Some ruby add-ons to make the code easier and prettier
- `spec`: RSpec expectations for the library and add-ons
